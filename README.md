# hypixel-npc-bazaar-flipping-calculator
Just a simple app to display the best item to flip from npc's to the bazaar at the moment, so that you won't have to check manually ever again.

# How to use
To use this bazaar flipping helper, just open it in your prefered browser or optionally download the app if you are on mac and buy the things that are at the top of the list when sorted by profit (default) from the npc's and sell them back to the bazaar right after. It is advised to still check if the website is right before doing this, since there might be some incorrect prices on the website. If that is the case, feel free to open a Issue or pr in this repository or contact me some other way.
